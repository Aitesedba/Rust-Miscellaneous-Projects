# Rust Challenges
This is my repository where I just put all the small rust programs I make! The collection will probably be small at first but I hope to be able to grow it out a bit, it mostly consists of cool visual interactives and other graphical projects!

## How to execute the projects?
To run a project, you simply do `cargo run --example <filename>`. This will run just the singular file for that one project.  Make sure you have rust analyzer and/or rust cargo manager to be able to run the files.
